## fuelpricemonitor adapter for ioBroker

This adapter retrieves the fuel (Diesel, Super and Gas) prices from the offical Austria database based on your configered geo-position.
Default schedule is done every 20 minutes and can be changed in the "instance" tab.  


**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)!
